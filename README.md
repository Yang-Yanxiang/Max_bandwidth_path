# TAMU CSCE 629 project

### Brief dicription:
- Name: Yanxiang Yang; UIN: 324006110
- Programming language: Python 3.51
- This program is to implement a network routing protocol using the data structures and algorithms studied in 629 class, including Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and heap data structure.

### Instruction to run the program:
- Please use following command to run the entire program: python3 main.py
- Enter comand '1' to generate and test graph1 that has 5000 vertices and every vertex has exactly 6 degree. This will automatically run and test three different algorithms based on graph1.
- Enter command '2' to generate and test graph2 that has 5000 vertices and every vertex has edges going to 20% of the other vertices
- Output include: 1. The running time of each algorithm 2. Vertices on the maximum bandwidth path. 3. The value of maximum bandwidth.
- You can run this program again and again. Every time you run this program, it will randomly generate a new graph with a pair of randomly choosed source and destination.
